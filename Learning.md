* VERSION 3: KEY LEARNINGS & IMPROVEMENTS
 * ============================================
 * 
 * WHAT I LEARNED FROM 2021 TO 2025:
 * 
 * 1. CODE ORGANIZATION
 *    Before: All code in one place, messy
 *    After: Structured with clear sections, comments
 *    Learning: Good organization makes code maintainable
 * 
 * 2. DATA STRUCTURES
 *    Before: Simple variables (int, float)
 *    After: Used struct for transaction history
 *    Learning: Structures help organize related data
 * 
 * 3. INPUT VALIDATION
 *    Before: Basic if-else checks
 *    After: Multiple validation layers, error handling
 *    Learning: Always validate user input to prevent crashes
 * 
 * 4. SECURITY
 *    Before: Single PIN attempt, simple integer
 *    After: Multiple attempts, string PIN, blocking
 *    Learning: Security features protect user data
 * 
 * 5. USER EXPERIENCE
 *    Before: Plain text, simple messages
 *    After: Beautiful UI with borders, emojis, clear feedback
 *    Learning: Good UI makes programs more professional
 * 
 * 6. ERROR HANDLING
 *    Before: Minimal error messages
 *    After: Clear error messages, input buffer clearing
 *    Learning: Handle errors gracefully to improve UX
 * 
 * 7. FEATURES
 *    Before: 3 basic functions
 *    After: 6 functions including history, receipts
 *    Learning: More features = more value for users
 * 
 * 8. CODE REUSABILITY
 *    Before: Repeated code in multiple places
 *    After: Helper functions (clearBuffer, pauseScreen)
 *    Learning: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
 * 
 * 9. CONSTANTS & MACROS
 *    Before: Hard-coded numbers everywhere
 *    After: #define for all constants
 *    Learning: Makes code easier to modify and maintain
 * 
 * 10. DOCUMENTATION
 *     Before: Minimal comments
 *     After: Detailed comments explaining logic
 *     Learning: Good comments help future you and others
 * 
 * TECHNICAL SKILLS GAINED:
 * - String manipulation (strcmp, strcpy, strlen)
 * - Time functions (time, localtime, strftime)
 * - Type definitions (typedef struct)
 * - Arrays and pointers
 * - Input buffer management
 * - Switch-case statements
 * - Function prototypes
 * - Return value checking
 * 
 * BEST PRACTICES LEARNED:
 * ✓ Always check return values
 * ✓ Clear input buffers after scanf
 * ✓ Use meaningful variable names
 * ✓ Add helpful error messages
 * ✓ Validate all user inputs
 * ✓ Use constants instead of magic numbers
 * ✓ Write modular, reusable functions
 * ✓ Add security features
 * ✓ Test edge cases
 * ✓ Document your code
 * 
 * EVOLUTION SUMMARY:
 * 2021: 80 lines, 3 features, basic functionality
 * 2025: 300+ lines, 6 features, professional quality
 * 
 * This journey shows how AI assistance can help
 * transform basic code into production-ready software
 * while teaching best practices along the way.
